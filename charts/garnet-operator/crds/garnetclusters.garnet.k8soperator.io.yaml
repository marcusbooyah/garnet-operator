                      AllowPrivilegeEscalation controls whether a process can gain more privileges
                       than its parent process. This bool directly controls if the no_new_privs flag
                       will be set on the container process. AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always
                       when the container is: 1) run as Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN Note that this

                      procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers. The default
                       is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for readonly paths
                       and masked paths. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.

                       will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0
                       (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such
                       validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in

                       May also be set in PodSecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and

                         minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an
                         eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than
                         MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with
                         the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. |
                         zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming
                         pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto
                         zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1).
                         - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When

                         eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod
                         Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew
                         is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology
                         keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                         As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                         scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is
                         nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are
                         integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be
                         DoNotSchedule.

                         For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5
                         and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                         |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so
                         "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same
                         labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new
                         Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.

                        WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the
                         spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule
                         it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                         but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                         skew.
                         A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if
                         every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some
                         topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with
                         the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P 
                         |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be
                         scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
                         zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be
                         imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required
                         field.
